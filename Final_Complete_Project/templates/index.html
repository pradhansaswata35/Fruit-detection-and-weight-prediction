    <h1 class="main-title">Welcome to Fruit Detection and Weight Prediction Website</h1>
    <p>The project introduces an intelligent real-time system that uses extended computer vision and deep learning
      techniques to record, classify and evaluate the weights of different fruits. The system is developed for dynamic
      environments such as supermarkets, warehouses and agricultural markets to improve efficiency, reduce human error,
      and support automatic checkout and inventory processes. This data record records a wide range of species and
      varieties, including detailed variations in size, texture, shape, color and maturity. Each image is meticulously
      commented, so the model can also learn the subtle differences between similar fruit categories. The model is
      trained using data magnification techniques such as rotation, brightness adjustment, and blockage to ensure that
      it is blocked under a variety of real-world conditions. The system has been tested for its ability to identify and
      classify several fruit types in a single frame, carefully count them, and estimate both the unit and the overall
      weight. This step checks the actual performance of the model in complex, overcrowded environments. Yolov9 handles
      high-speed frames, identifying several fruit types, and extracting important features such as size, shape,
      texture, and color. These properties are used to understand the weight of each fruit, both individually and
      together. This makes the prediction algorithm based on visual inputs. Real-time classification and weight data can
      be automatically fed to retail systems. Therefore, faster checkouts and more accurate billing can be possible
      without manual intervention. This reduces labor costs and minimizes price errors. This ensures portability, low
      latency and consistent performance in environments with limited computing resources. A user-friendly graphics
      interface allows employees to visualize awareness, monitor their systems and manage updates without the need for
      technical know-how.
      Finally, the system is scalable and customizable. New fruit categories can be added with minimal retraining, and
      the architecture supports a wide range of applications, from small-scale retail setups to industrial-scale fruit
      sorting processes.</p>

        Watch our real-time demo that shows how the system detects fruits like Apple, Orange, Banana, and Carrot using a
        camera and instantly predicts their weight. The video highlights the bounding boxes, labels, and live weight
        predictions made using our trained model. This demo helps you understand how computer vision and machine
        learning come together to create an accurate and contactless fruit weighing system.These visual cues are then
        analyzed to estimate the weightbased on shape, size, and texture. The system is smart enough to detect multiple
        fruits at once and calculate the total weight in real-time. This solution can be used in supermarkets,
        warehouses, or farms to improve efficiency and reduce human effort. No physical touch or manual weighing is
        needed—everything happens through a simple video feed, making the process fast, reliable, and scalable.

          apple, banana).</li>
        <li>Visual features like size, color, shape, and texture are extracted for further analysis, including weight
          estimation and ripeness classification.</li>
        <li>The system displays the detected fruits with labeled bounding boxes in real-time, enabling fast and accurate
          identification even in complex, mixed-fruit scenarios.</li>

    <h1 class="main-title">Weight Prediction of Fruits</h1>
    <div class="description">
      <ul>
        <li>
          We have developed a real-time, contactless fruit detection and weight estimation system designed for use in
          retail counters, automated checkout points, and fruit sorting facilities. This innovative solution uses live
          video input to detect fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, and carrots without any physical contact or
          weighing scales.
        </li>

        <li>
          At the core of the system is the advanced YOLOv9 object detection model, which accurately identifies and
          outlines
          each fruit within the camera frame using bounding boxes. Once detected, the system goes beyond identification
          by
          extracting detailed visual features of each fruit, including its size, shape, and color.</li>

        <li>
          These extracted features are then passed to a dedicated regression model, specifically trained on a large
          of real fruit images with corresponding weight labels. This allows the system to predict the weight of each
          based solely on its visual characteristics. By learning the correlation between appearance and weight, the
          delivers accurate predictions in real time.
        </li>

        <li>
          This contactless weight estimation method offers several advantages. It eliminates the need for physical
          scales, reducing equipment costs and maintenance. It also enhances hygiene by minimizing human contact with
          fresh produce, making it ideal for modern retail and food handling environments. Additionally, it speeds up
          checkout and sorting processes, improving overall operational efficiency.
        </li>

        <li>
          Our system represents a significant step forward in the automation of fruit handling, providing a practical,
          scalable solution for businesses looking to modernize their operations with intelligent, AI-driven technology.
